// 30. You have k apple boxes full of apples. Each square box of size m contains m × m apples. You just noticed two interesting properties about the boxes:

//     The smallest box is size 1, the next one is size 2,..., all the way up to size k.
//     Boxes that have an odd size contain only yellow apples. Boxes that have an even size contain only red apples.

// Your task is to calculate the difference between the number of red apples and the number of yellow apples.

function appleBoxes(k) {
    let even = 0;
    let odd = 0;
    for(let i = 1; i <= k; i++){
        if (i % 2 === 0){
            even += (i * i);
        } else {
            odd += (i * i);
        }
    }
    return even - odd;
