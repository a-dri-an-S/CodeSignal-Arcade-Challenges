// 22. You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line. Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer. Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.
